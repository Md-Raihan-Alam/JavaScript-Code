I.	INSTALLING THE GAME:
============================

NOTE: Avoid minimising the installer during install.

Insert Disc 1 into your CD/DVD drive. If you have Autorun enabled the game should start installing immediately. If Autorun is disabled, browse to the CD and double-click on 'setup.exe'.
You will be prompted for your choice of language for the installer program - select it from the drop-down list.
You will then be asked to enter the directory you wish to install the game to.
After a few minutes you will then be asked to insert Disc 2 to continue the install. Swap Disc 1 for Disc 2 and select 'OK'.



II.	RUNNING THE GAME:
=========================

After you install "Project IGI2: Covert Strike" there will be an "IGI 2" shortcut on your desktop. Double-click this to start the game.
Alternatively you can start the game by going to: Start Menu -> Programs -> Codemasters -> IGI 2 -> Play IGI 2.



III.	STARTING AND JOINING A MULTIPLAYER GAME:
================================================

1. Joining a Multiplayer game:
------------------------------

- Start the game and select 'Multiplayer'.
- Then choose 'Join Game' and click on 'SEARCH LAN' to find all available games on a LAN or 'SEARCH INTERNET' to find all available servers online. For the latter option you need to be already connected to the internet.
- On this screen you can enter a name for yourself and an IP address of a server if you know one.
- Choose the game you wish to join, using the option at the top of the list to sort by number of players, ping and name, and then click 'JOIN'.
- The game will then load to the 'Select Team' screen.


2. Starting a Multiplayer game:
-------------------------------

- Start the game and select 'Multiplayer'. Then choose 'Start Server'.
- Enter your name and the server name at the top of the screen.
- Click on 'Map List' to choose the map(s) you wish to play, selecting 'OK' when you're finished.
- You can also set the maximum number of players you wish to allow on the server, the number of spectators, the port number, whether weapons dropped by enemies will remain to be picked up, whether healthpacks are allowed, or whether you wish to start this game as a dedicated server. NOTE: if you choose this final option you will not be able to play the game on this PC. See below for information on Dedicated Servers.
- Click 'OK' to start the game.
- The game will then load to the 'Select Team' screen.


3. Setting up a dedicated server for a Multiplayer game:
--------------------------------------------------------

- Create a shortcut to 'igi2.exe', right-click on it and select 'Properties' and add 'window quiet serverdedicated port26001 level02' after '...igi2.exe' in the 'Target:' box. Use this shortcut to run a dedicated server. It will display as a black window which means the server is running. The list of multiplayer maps is:

level01 = Redstone
level02 = Forestraid
level03 = Sandstorm
level04 = Timberland
level05 = Chinese Temple

The available port numbers are port26001 -> port26014
